##Measurement
It’s essential to measure how your service is performing, so you can make sure that your service continues to meet user needs in a cost-effective and efficient way. Do this by monitoring metrics. Your metrics are a way to start discussing the strengths and weaknesses of your service, and will help your team to find ways of improving your service over time.
 
The digital service standard requires four key performance indicators be used to measure the success of your service:
 
1. cost per transaction
2. digital take-up
3. completion rate
4. user satisfaction
 
These aren’t the only things your service should measure. Identify unique indicators for your service to help judge its effectiveness. 

- **Measurement** — Data you need to measure and monitor
