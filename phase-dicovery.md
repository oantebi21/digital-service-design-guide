##Discovery Phase
What are the needs of your users? What services currently meet those? How are they performing? What technological or policy related constraints might there be?
 
Before you start building a service you need to build up a picture of what the context for that service is. That means lots of user research, close analysis of policies, laws and business needs, and workshops and interviews which establish the criteria for success of your service.
 
The discovery phase will give you a high-level understanding of user needs, what the existing service landscape looks like and a sense of what your initial prototypes will explore.
 
You’ll need to think about user needs for digital and assisted digital users. As a start, you’ll need to understand what proportion of your users you think will need assisted digital support.
 
The high-level business context will become clear, and you’ll begin setting targets for your KPIs.
 
You’ll also get a better understanding of the legacy interfaces and infrastructure you must deal with, and what existing process are in place for replacing or decommissioning these.
