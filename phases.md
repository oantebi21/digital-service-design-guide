##Making a service
 
Learn about the different phases of service design and get guidance for the phase you’re in now.
 
###Discovery
 
A short phase, in which you start researching the needs of your service’s users, find out what you should be measuring, and explore technological or policy-related constraints.
 
Learn about the discovery phase

 
###Alpha
 
A short phase in which you prototype solutions for your users needs. You’ll be testing with a small group of users or stakeholders, and getting early feedback about the design of the service.
 
Learn about the alpha phase

 
###Beta
 
You’re developing against the demands of a live environment, understanding how to build and scale while meeting user needs. You’ll also be releasing a version to test in public.
 
Learn about the beta phase

 
###Live
 
The work doesn’t stop once your service is live. You’ll be iteratively improving your service, reacting to new needs and demands, and meeting targets set during its development.
 
Learn about the live phase

 
###Retirement
 
Even the best services may eventually reach retirement. That should be treated with the same care as went into the building and maintaining of that service.
