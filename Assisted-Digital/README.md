##Assisted Digital
Most users will be able to use new and redesigned services unaided, but there are some who will need help. This support is referred to as assisted digital.

Assisted digital support might be provided in person, on the phone, or through other channels. Users will be given help to use the service, or someone will use it alongside them on their behalf.
