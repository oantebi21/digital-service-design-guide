##Technology
 
Government needs services that are genuinely agile and responsive to changing needs – where change reduces, not raises, cost and risk – making government more productive, and our public services better. To do that, Chief Technology, Information and Digital Officers need to help government agencies make major structural improvements to how technology is used and procured, alongside an approach which:
 
- concentrates on user needs
- puts outcomes, not inputs, first
- uses openness to our advantage – open data, open standards, open source, open markets
- ensures that technology becomes so good that our colleagues, citizens and businesses want to use it
