##Phases
Building a digital service is a complex task, with many risks. By breaking development into phases you minimise risk, learning about what works and what doesn’t, iterating as you go.
 
As the service progresses through development you’ll find out more about users’ needs, development requirements and the conditions your service will be operating in. The level of detail, complexity and risk will increase along the way.
 
This approach allows the team making and operating the service to start small, learn fast, and provide value to users as soon as possible.
 
- **Service design phases** — Learn about the discovery, alpha, beta, and live phases of service design

- **Discovery phase** — Find out what your users need, what to measure and what your constraints are

- **Alpha phase** — Build a prototype, test it with users and learn from it

- **Beta phase** —Scaling up and going public

- **Live phase** —Learn how to continuously improve your live service

- **Retirement phase** — Learn what to do when your service is retired or superseded
